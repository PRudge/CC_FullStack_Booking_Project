# BookingPal

BookingPal is a group project completed with a 1 week deadline. Built using Spring, React, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3.

Task: 
You have been tasked to create a booking system for a brand new restaurant. The restaurant needs a way to book and arrange tables for customers who are booking over the phone. This system is for the staff to use.

- [ ] Display a list of customers ordered by frequency of visits

# Project Extensions:

- [x] Don't allow double bookings
- [ ] Add a customer's receipt to a booking so you can view their previous orders and how much they spent
